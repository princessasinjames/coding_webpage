        different coding languages. For now, I will discuss Python, C, and C++.</p>

        <!-- Discussion: -->
        <h2>&#11088 Python</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 3em;">Python is widely considered a basic coding language for beginners.
        It has less restrictions on format.
        If you know C/C++, then you know how much format can make or break a program.
        For instance: forgetting a semicolon in a 200 line program gives an error in the terminal after running the seeminlgy correct program.
        This brings me to the topic of running the code. To run code on an up-to-date mac,
        you type "python3 filename.py" into the terminal once you have navigated to the file
        and can see it in the list after running "ls" in the terminal. Then type "./a.out" and enter.
        I will mention later how to run C and C++.</p>

        <h2>&#11088 C language</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 3em;">C is a more complicated coding language where you must end statements with a semicolon.
        Furthermore, unlike Python you cannot simply indent a looped instruction.
        To create a loop such as a while, for, or do-while loop, you must use indentation and curly brackets.
        This brings me to the topic of coding ettiquette.
        This entails giving variables names that can be understood by someone else,
        not putting a comment on every single line of code,
        including comments to clarify complicated parts of your code,
        using consistent/reasonable indentation throughout your code,
        , and not writing compact code with a lack of whitespaces. As I mentioned earlier, to run the code,
        you would type "gcc filename.c". Then run "./a.out".</p>

        <h2>&#11088 C++</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 3em;">C++ is a coding language that is very similar to C. There are of course some differences.
        What I am saying is that C++ is C language with more.
        Some differences are C++'s usage of class, and cin/cout.
        With these differences, there are unique libraries to import functions from diverse libraries.
        For instance, C++ uses "&ltiostream&gt" for cin and cout, though like C language,
        you could also use "printf" and scanf. As I mentioned earlier, to run the code,
        you would type "g++ filename.c". Then run "./a.out".</p> <br>
