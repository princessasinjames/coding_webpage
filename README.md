# Coding_Webpage
# How to run the webpage:
This code is meant to run if 4 conditions are true:
1. the html file is in a folder called html
2. the css file is in a folder called css,
3. the video is in a folder called mp4 which is also in a folder called video
4. the image is in a folder called image.

These folder are all in one shared folder.

# The alternative:
This webpage was designed this way to organize the files it uses. Though, the css file and\
images could just have their links to the folders removed and be placed into a single folder.
